## Tutorials

| Tutorial | What you learn | Open in Colab | View on GitHub |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| **Good Models from Bad Data (Classification)** | How to build robust classifiers when labels are noisy; design choices (batch size, LR) and their impact. | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fatmaelzahraaeid/TheBioMLPlayBook_tutorials/blob/main/Noise/good_models_from_bad_data_classification.ipynb) | [Notebook](Noise/good_models_from_bad_data_classification.ipynb) |

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: In Colab, go to **Runtime â†’ Change runtime type** to enable GPU if training is heavy.
